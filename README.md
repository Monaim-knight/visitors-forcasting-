# Website Visitors Time Series Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end time series analysis and forecasting on website visitor data. Using R, we analyze daily website traffic, test for stationarity, explore autocorrelation, fit an ARIMA model, and generate actionable forecasts. The project is designed to showcase data analysis, modeling, and problem-solving skills to recruiters and potential employers.

## Key Skills & Tools Demonstrated
- **R Programming**: Data manipulation, visualization, and modeling
- **Time Series Analysis**: Stationarity testing, ACF/PACF interpretation
- **ARIMA Modeling**: Model selection, fitting, and forecasting
- **Troubleshooting**: Handling real-world data issues and adapting code
- **Reporting**: Clear documentation and interpretation of results

## How to Run the Analysis
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd forcasting
   ```
2. **Open the project in RStudio**
3. **Install required R packages** (if not already installed):
   ```r
   install.packages(c("tseries", "forecast", "ggplot2", "readr", "lmtest"))
   ```
4. **Open and knit** `scripts/website_visitors_analysis.Rmd` to generate the analysis and plots.
5. **Read** `scripts/website_visitors_analysis_interpretation.md` for a summary and interpretation of the results.

## What Recruiters Should Notice
- Ability to handle and clean real-world data
- Proficiency in time series modeling and interpretation
- Clear, well-documented code and analysis
- Problem-solving skills (see troubleshooting section in the interpretation report)
- Communication of technical results to a non-technical audience

## Example Outputs
*You can add screenshots of your plots or a sample of your forecast output here.*
